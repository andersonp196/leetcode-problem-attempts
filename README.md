# leetcode-problem-attempts
This is a repository to archive all of my attempts on problems from https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/
I plan on attempting problems using Java and not looking up solutions online while I solve the problem my own way. After submitting an accepted solution, I will look up how others solved the problem and note what I learned from their solution. I hope this to be an effective way of refining my programmatical thinking!
